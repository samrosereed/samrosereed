The goal for this project was to build a two player Fishing Tournament game using fish object classes.  
  
Two players alternate turns and fish for 12 “months” and sell their fish to raise the most money. Whoever raises the most money during that time wins the game. During that time, there are illegal fish and the player has the choice of whether they keep or return the illegal fish. To keep th fish, the player must bribe the policeman to keep the fish but if the bribe is not high enough, the player recieves a fine, hindering their chances to win.

Some of the challenges were balancing the game, so that neither player had an advantage and creating a convincing stock market simulation.  We wanted the game to be fun to play and make sure it wasn’t too easy to win, so we added extra interactions with the police and fish buyer to keep it exciting. Coordinating teamwork effectively was also a challenge, with each team member responsible for specific fish families, and handling various classes and arrays, including child, parent, and superclass, sorting them by size.

This project underscored the importance of communication in collaborative coding, mirroring professional settings where individuals are tasked with specific responsibilities. The experience enhanced my sense of responsibility and deepened my understanding of Java and data structures, ultimately leaving me satisfied with the project's outcome.
