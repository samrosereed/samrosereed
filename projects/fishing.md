  which simulates real fishing with options to cast out, view the catch, and release fish. The game introduced a challenge with legal and illegal fish categories: legal fish could be kept, while illegal ones required releasing the entire catch. The primary difficulty lay in coordinating teamwork effectively, with each team member responsible for specific fish families, and handling various classes and arrays, including child, parent, and superclass, sorting them by size.

This project underscored the importance of communication in collaborative coding, mirroring professional settings where individuals are tasked with specific responsibilities. The experience enhanced my sense of responsibility and deepened my understanding of Java and data structures, ultimately leaving me satisfied with the project's outcome.
