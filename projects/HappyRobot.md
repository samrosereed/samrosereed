I was interested in exploring human - robot interactions and seeing how much the NAO robots could recognize human emotions. 

This all stemmed from the "Get Smile" behavior in Choregraphe. I was interested in creating a robot that could help with people's mental health, so that if someone was looking sad, NAO would tell a joke to cheer them up.
