## I. Introduction

Artificial Intelligence has rapidly changed how many of us approach our problems.  For students, the accessibility of AI has been an absolute game changer for how we learn.  In this essay I will discuss how AI tools, methodologies, and concepts have influenced my learning and understanding of software engineering principles in ICS 314. 

## II. Personal Experience with AI:
##### 1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
- I utilized AI to explain the necessary componenets of the solution. 
  
##### 2. In-class Practice WODs
- Here I tried to complete the WODs without AI but when I got stuck, AI was helpful in guiding me in the right direction but rarely provided complete solutions.  Further refining was often essential.
  
##### 3. In-class WODs
- Early on, I avoided using AI to push myself to solve problems independently but later, I began using ChatGPT and Github Copilot for helpful hints.  Depending on the code, AI proved extremely helpful and only needed minor adjustments but other times, I felt like the AI written code was not accurate at all.  Since the in class WODs were time sensitive, I learned that while AI could be helpful, you could not completely rely on it.
