## Large marine debris reporting, dispatching, documenting platform
##### By Bibiana Garcia, Princess Balasico, Heinrich Maertens, Samantha Reed, Omar Zaidi

# Overview

## The Problem

In the context of environmental stewardship, marine debris management poses a significant challenge. Various organizations and individuals are actively involved in detecting, removing, and responsibly disposing of debris in our oceans. However, there exists a critical need to enhance communication and data recording processes, which is currently lacking. This essay explores a proposal for a comprehensive Centralized Database and Dispatch System designed to address this issue.

## The Solution

The proposed Centralized Database and Dispatch System offers a robust solution to streamline the management of marine debris. It focuses on real-time public access, efficient communication tools, and comprehensive data collection at all stages of debris management. This system empowers both civilians and debris removal organizations to collaborate effectively and contribute to a cleaner environment.

# Mockup Page Ideas

To visualize the functionality and user experience of the Centralized Database and Dispatch System, several mockup page ideas can be explored:

- **Homepage:** An engaging landing page welcoming users and providing an overview of the system's capabilities.

- **Debris Reporting Page:** A user-friendly interface for civilians to report debris, including options to specify location, type, and attach photos.

- **Organization Dashboard:** A dedicated dashboard for debris pick-up organizations, featuring a list of reported debris, claims, and resolved cases.

- **Interactive Map:** A dynamic map displaying reported debris locations, allowing users to explore data visually.

- **User Profile Page:** User accounts and profiles, offering a personalized experience and the ability to track reported debris.

- **Data Analytics Dashboard:** An analytical dashboard for visualizing debris data over time, helping users understand patterns and trends.

- **Mobile App Screens:** Design screens for the mobile application, ensuring seamless reporting and tracking on mobile devices.

# Use Case Ideas

The Centralized Database and Dispatch System can cater to various use cases, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness:

- **Civic Engagement:** Local residents can use the system to report debris in their area, promoting community engagement in environmental efforts.

- **Beach Cleanup Organizations:** Non-profit organizations can claim and manage debris removal tasks efficiently, enhancing their impact.

- **Government Agencies:** Government entities can access data to make informed decisions and allocate resources for marine debris management.

- **Researchers:** Scientists can utilize the data to conduct research on marine debris, contributing to a better understanding of the issue.

- **Educational Programs:** The system can support educational initiatives, allowing students to learn about environmental conservation through practical involvement.

- **Corporate Responsibility:** Companies can participate in clean-up efforts and track their environmental impact using the system.

# Beyond the Basics

To further enhance the system's capabilities and impact, consider these advanced features and expansions:

- **Machine Learning Integration:** Implement machine learning algorithms to classify debris types automatically from images and predict debris hotspots based on historical data.

- **Global Collaboration:** Expand the system's reach to support international collaboration, enabling cross-border coordination in marine debris management.

- **Public Awareness Campaigns:** Integrate educational resources and campaigns within the system to raise awareness and encourage responsible disposal practices.

- **Blockchain for Data Integrity:** Utilize blockchain technology to ensure the immutability and integrity of debris data, enhancing trust and transparency.

- **Integration with Drones and IoT Devices:** Incorporate drones and IoT devices to enhance debris detection and monitoring capabilities in remote or challenging-to-reach areas.

- **Gamification Elements:** Add gamification features to incentivize user engagement, such as rewarding users for reporting debris or participating in clean-up events.

By exploring these advanced features and expansions, the Centralized Database and Dispatch System can evolve into a powerful tool for marine debris management, making a substantial impact on environmental conservation.
