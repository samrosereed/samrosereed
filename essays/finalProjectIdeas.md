# Building a Centralized Debris Management System for Environmental Stewardship
#### By Bibiana Garcia, Princess Balasico, Heinrich Maertens, Samantha Reed, Omar Zaidi
## Introduction

Large marine debris (mostly plastic derelict fishing gear) washes ashore
frequently in Hawaii and needs to be removed. The detection by public needs
to be more efficiently dispatched to the removal organizations. Their removal
efforts need to be coordinated. And in order to quantify how much debris is
being removed and disposed, a database is needed that captures information
from detection in the ocean, removal, debris type assessments, to
disposal/recycling choices.

## Centralized Database and Dispatch System

### Comprehensive Data Collection

Efficient communication is the cornerstone of this system. It enables organizations to receive and act upon reports swiftly, minimizing response times and maximizing debris removal efficiency. The system includes a hotline, a user-friendly website, and a mobile application for easy reporting.

The cradle-to-grave database captures information at all seven steps of debris management, ensuring that no crucial data is lost in the process. The database tracks debris amounts and proportions by mapped location, removal efficiency, debris type, polymer type, and disposal mechanism.

## Quantifying Debris Removal

To measure the effectiveness of debris removal efforts, a robust database is indispensable. This database collects information from the initial detection of debris in the ocean to its removal, including assessments of debris types and disposal/recycling choices.


## User-Friendly Interface

### Civilian User Side

The platform offers a user-friendly interface for civilians to report debris. Key features include the ability to specify whether the debris is on land or in the water, share coordinates, and attach photos. Civilians have the choice to create a profile or report anonymously. An option for a call-back number is available for registered users, facilitating contact by authorities. To avoid repetitive submissions, the system identifies if the reported debris matches a previous report and suggests the possibility of adding comments or additional information.

### Debris Pick-Up Organizations Side

For debris pick-up organizations, the system allows for user creation with the option to choose to create an organization or work under an existing one. Organizations have special privileges, such as viewing a list of reported debris and claiming unresolved cases. They must adhere to specific timelines for debris pick-up, with a backup option in case the primary pick-up falls through. Organizations are also responsible for updating the system with information about the debris, including weight, size, type, and location.

The database keeps track of reported debris in three categories: unresolved, claimed, and resolved. Users and organizations access these lists through the website/app. These lists are updated using a combination of manual inputs and importing data from Google Sheets. To ensure data integrity, a text sheet stores all data locally in case of connectivity issues with the Google Sheets platform.

## Conclusion

The proposed Centralized Database and Dispatch System provides a comprehensive solution to the challenges of marine debris management. By enabling real-time public access, enhancing communication among stakeholders, and systematically collecting data at every stage of debris management, this system can be a game-changer in our efforts to protect the environment. It empowers both civilians and debris removal organizations to join forces and work together towards a cleaner, healthier planet.
