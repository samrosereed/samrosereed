## Introduction

Coding standards are often dismissed as trivial by many in the world of software development. These standards encompass seemingly minor details like the number of spaces for indentation or the placement of a close-curly-brace. However, I strongly believe that coding standards are not just about aesthetics; they play a pivotal role in improving code quality and can even expedite the learning process of a programming language. In this essay, I will share my personal perspective on coding standards, emphasizing their importance and exploring their impact, especially in the context of using ESLint with IntelliJ.

## The Significance of Coding Standards

Coding standards, at their core, are a set of guidelines that developers adhere to when writing code. They serve as a shared language that facilitates collaboration and ensures consistency across a project. At first glance, these standards may seem pedantic, but they can have a profound impact on software development.

One of the most compelling arguments in favor of coding standards is the enhancement of code readability. Clean and consistent code is easier to understand, maintain, and debug. When you revisit your own code or collaborate with other developers, you'll find that adhering to standards greatly simplifies the process. As a 20-year-old developer, I have experienced firsthand how coding standards can save me from the confusion of deciphering messy code, allowing me to focus on problem-solving and creativity.

## Learning through Coding Standards

Interestingly, coding standards can also function as an educational tool. When you start learning a programming language, it can be overwhelming. However, following coding standards can provide structure and guidance. For instance, adhering to conventions for variable naming and code organization can help beginners grasp the syntax and best practices more quickly.

## ESLint and IntelliJ: A New Perspective

ESLint, coupled with the IntelliJ IDE, offers a powerful way to enforce coding standards in real-time. After my first week of using ESLint with IntelliJ, I find it to be a transformative experience.

**Painful or Useful?**: ESLint's green checkmark can be both painful and useful, depending on your perspective. At times, it feels frustrating when your code is littered with red squiggly lines, indicating violations of coding standards. However, these warnings are invaluable. They force you to pause, reflect, and correct your code, ensuring that it aligns with best practices. In this sense, the green checkmark is an ally, pushing you towards cleaner and more efficient code.

**Learning Tool:** ESLint goes beyond being just a strict taskmaster. It becomes a mentor that guides you through the language's nuances and best practices. As a young developer, I appreciate how ESLint helps me internalize these standards, making me a better coder with each correction.

**Consistency and Collaboration:** ESLint, integrated with IntelliJ, fosters consistency across a team of developers. It ensures that everyone follows the same set of rules, minimizing conflicts and misunderstandings. This harmonious coding environment not only improves code quality but also makes collaborative projects more enjoyable and efficient.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, coding standards are far from trivial, and they should hold a central place in the toolkit of every software developer. Their significance extends beyond mere aesthetics, influencing code quality, readability, and even the learning curve for programming languages. My experience with ESLint and IntelliJ has further reinforced my belief in the importance of coding standards. While it can be challenging to see the red squiggly lines, they are a testament to the continuous journey of improvement that coding standards inspire. Embracing these standards not only elevates our coding skills but also enhances our ability to work harmoniously in a team-driven industry. So, to answer the question posed at the beginning, yes, I wholeheartedly agree that coding standards are indispensable in the world of software engineering.
