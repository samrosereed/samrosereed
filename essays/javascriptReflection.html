  <p>Javascript is an interesting language, it’s been really fun learning to use it. This is my first time working with Javascript and I enjoyed the Codecademy exercises as an introduction to the language.  It does remind me a lot of Java and C but it’s still different enough where I feel like I’m learning something new. I find the syntax of Javascript aesthetically pleasing and some of the features like arrow functions and promises were cool concepts. JavaScript definitely has its good sides, like lots of helpful tools and being familiar to use. But it also has some tricky parts that can cause problems. Whether it’s a good or bad choice for software engineering I think depends on how well it fits with a particular project.</p>

<p>The athletic software engineering concept was very intimidating at first.  Coding is usually something that takes some time for me, so the expectation that I would have to write a functioning code in a limited amount of time was quite anxiety-inducing.  The practice WODS are definitely very useful and practicing those a couple of times really helped me get the concepts down.  Going to the TA’s practice WODs and doing the in class practice WODS was helpful and I was surprised at my ability to complete them.  Getting the WOD completed in a short amount of time was a really satisfying experience that I enjoyed a lot.  While it will definitely be challenging, I think this will be a good way for me to learn because it forces me to think about things quickly and critically.</p>
